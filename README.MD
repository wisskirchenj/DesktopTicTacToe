# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Java Desktop Track of hyperskill.org's JetBrain Academy.

Purpose of doing this project, is practising some more plain java, refreshing some javax.swing, though a bit outdated...
Also, and maybe the main purpose, why we do the project: This is one graduate project of the Java Desktop Application
Developer Track, which is needed to complete this track. Moreover it covers a lot of yet undone Topics - e.g of Swing.
